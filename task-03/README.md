I started this task after going through the neal.fun Perfect Circle website and then learnt how to use the Canvas API. At first it was a bit confusing, but after some practice I was able to get a smooth understanding of it. My next step was to build the website structure and later implement features like tracking the score and switching between different modes.

For calculating the score, I tried different approaches and finally ended up using variance to calculate the accuracy of the circle. Another challenge was checking if the point at the center lay inside the drawn circle. I did some searching online but couldnâ€™t find a good solution, so I took some help from AI, which suggested using the ray casting algorithm. It took me some time to understand, but I was able to implement it successfully.

After the main logic was done, I added extra features like music while drawing, difficulty modes, clear/reset option, dot size variations, time-based bonus, and a toggle for dark or light mode.

Overall, building the logic for this task was a bit challenging but I enjoyed the process and learnt a lot while completing it.experience
