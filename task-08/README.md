To begin this task, I first understood how CSS Battle works and learned how to optimize code to fewer lines. For that, I referenced some websites:

https://www.reddit.com/r/css/comments/lb0y6k/how_do_people_on_css_battle_do_it_with_so_little/

https://cssbattle.dev/tips

For example: I havenâ€™t closed tags because CSS Battle tips state that we can omit the closing tags, etc.

Then I tried 15 daily targets and stored the code in index.html by adding the HTML structure for those tasks, and committed it as asked in the task to the repo.

Task Experience:
Writing code for some shapes was a bit challenging, but I learned some cool stuff during this task.
