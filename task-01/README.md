## PART -1
 To begin this task, 
              I first cloned this repo and then cretaed a folder called codes and started with the rest of the tasks 
    
## PART -2 
      In this part we are required to  some directories with "0x" an the spells stored in file "Spell_0y" and
     it's given that x is first perfect number which is found to be 6 after some searching and y is the result that comes after differentiating (xÂ²-7x) w.r.t 'x' which turns out
      to be 5  and after checking them with their respective folders and files the obtained spell is : Impedimenta

     And by running this spell file in the spellbook folder the obtained code is :
             aHR0cHM6Ly9naX
            
### The commands used :
           cd : to open a directory 
           ls : to fetch files
           cat: to read the content of file
           python3:used to run the python spell files
           
## PART -3
    This time to find the x and y values we need to find out the first element that is needed to make semi-conductors and that element is Germanium and atomic number is 32     with this the value of y is 2 and the value of x is 3 and with this the spell we got is  " Stupefy "  
    And by running this spell file in the spellbook folder the obtained code is :
    RodWIuY29tL1RoZ

## PART -4
    For this part of task we need change our branch into the branch which is taught by Professor Lupin at Hogwarts which is "defenseAgainstTheDarkArts" by using git branch -a we 
    can check all the branches present in this repo anb by using git checkout <branch name> we can go to that branch and now  we encountered a Sphinx
    and to pass safely we have to solve the riddle , and for solving the riddle there was a hint called shape shifiting creature which is Boggart
    And the spell used to fight this creature is "Riddikulus"
    
     I was successful to get the code for this spell and that is : Uh1bnRzbWFuNC9U
     
### Commands used:
        git branch -a: to find all the git branches present 
        git checkout <branch_name>: Switched between branches
        git checkout <remote branch> <Relative path of the file to be copied from the other branch>:Used to copy a specific file from another branch (or commit) into your     current  working branch without switching branches
        
## PART - 5
    In this by using git checkout we need to shift to graveyard and there we need to find a spell hidden in the commit logs and after going through every commit i finally found the spell that is "'Priori Incantatem.py"
### Commands used:
          git log : to checkout all the commits that were done to the task
          git show --name-only <commit-hash> : gives the details of a specific commit 
  
  i entered all the codes into finalcode.txt
## PART-6
The final code is aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs

In this part :
             After decoding the finalcode.txt with the bash command "echo <base64 encodedString> | base64 --decode" ,the decoded code leads to a github link 

 github link : https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell

And cloned this repo to terminal and foundout the TheOneThatEndsItAll.txt and TheOneThatEndsItAll.py files
### Commands used:
        echo <base64enocodedstring> | base64 --decode .

## USED COMMANDS:
git clone: clones the repo to your local device
git add : Stages the specified file.

git status: Displays the files that undergone modification or changes.
git commit:it keeps track of the staged changes in the repository. The -m flag allows you to include a message describing the changes

#### MY REVIEW :
This task was an intersting one , during this task I have learnt various git and teminal commands .
