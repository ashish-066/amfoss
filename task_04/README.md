I began this task by first importing the CSV data into MySQL. For that, I created a new MySQL database called movies_db and wrote a Python script import_csv.py to create the table automatically in the database, read data from the movies.csv file, and insert all records into MySQL. This part was quite fast because I already had a good understanding of MySQL and Python. However, building the dashboard page for displaying the data was a bit more challenging for me. I approached this by first learning the basics of PySide6 and experimenting with it. After getting a hang of it, I started building the required methods such as set_search_mode, toggle_column, and execute_search. I also included new methods like populate_table to display the data in the table and load_default_data to show data by default when the app starts. Finally, I ended the task by implementing the export_csv option.

Task experience:
In this task, the importing part was easy, but the dashboard part was a bit challenging. Still, I am glad that I gained good knowledge about how to use the PySide6 library and how to link a Python script to a database.
